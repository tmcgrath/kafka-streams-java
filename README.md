## Kafka Streams in Scala Examples

Kafka Streams in..... Java this time!

Some folks asked me for the Scala examples to be translated to Java versions.  So, I did.

#### Kafka Streams Joins

This is all about
joining topics in Kafka Streams.
KTable, KStream, GlobalKTable.

Compare the tests.

More on the original Scala version here [https://www.supergloo.com/kafka-streams/kafka-streams-joins-examples/](https://www.supergloo.com/kafka-streams/kafka-streams-joins-examples/)

I'm interested your questions and feedback on how this can be improved.  TIA
